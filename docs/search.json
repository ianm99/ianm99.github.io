    "text": "I’ve had the opportunity to study a wide range of subjects during my university career. My undergraduate specializations in materials science and applied mathematics were naturally interdisciplinary fields that took me across many scientific domains, from organic chemistry to geomorphology and from vector calculus to computational physics. Over time I realised whatever area of science I found myself in, the fun part is always when the measurements are in and it’s time to find out what they mean: in essence, data science. I took a year off from school to do an internship with the government of Canada where I saw data science in action, and my decision was made. My master’s degree has sharpened my technical skills and exposed me to an amazing array of data science applications, which I’m excited to now put to work!"
